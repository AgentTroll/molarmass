# `molarmass`

I got bored in chem.

I honestly could have made something like my 
[`saved-posts`](https://github.com/AgentTroll/saved-posts)
project where everything was practically in a single class,
but I decided not to.

In fact, I also decided to purposely over-engineer and
incorporate [BDD](https://docs.cucumber.io/bdd/overview/)
into the development process, just cause why not?

Essentially, what this project is intended to do is to find
the molar mass of a given formula of a substance.
